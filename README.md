# Chute: Automation for Rancher-based Kubernetes Clusters

This project is to solve a need to spinning of Rancher-based Kubernetes clusters for development, testing, and experimentation. There is support for a standalone Rancher server using Docker and support creating an RKE cluster using both Windows and Linux.

## Naming is hard

Like most things in the Rancher world, this is named after the cattle chute. The idea is this allows a quick and painless way of creating Rancher servers and RKE clusters for development, testing, QA, and even production needs with the correct tweaks.

## Influence

This is going to lean heavily on the structure of the [Microsoft Bedrock](https://github.com/microsoft/bedrock) project. I really enjoy that organization and structure
for a project as it makes it easy to extend and build upon.
